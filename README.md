# Stop-Watch_in_Assembly
Here's a stopwatch that I created last summer using assembly language. It was very raw and interesting to use such a low level language to code something so seemingly simple. However, attempting to code anything took a deep understanding of the PIC18F4520 microcontroller. Around 6 projects were done for this microcontroller, however this is the one I built myself without a manual.
